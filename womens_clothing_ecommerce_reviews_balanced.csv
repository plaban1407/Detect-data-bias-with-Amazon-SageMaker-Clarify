-1,I wanted to love this top. but  it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful  but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.,Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.,Blouses
-1,This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d  and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately  this top will be going back.,Blouses
-1,Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.,Blouses
-1,I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would,Blouses
-1,If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.,Blouses
-1,I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.,Blouses
-1,Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state  it is short and wide. i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(,Blouses
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!",Blouses
0,I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.,Blouses
0,I bought this tank for work  but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs  5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose  which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist  and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though  not to heavy and not too thin.,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.,Blouses
0,I loved the look and feel of this shirt the moment i saw it. it would be so versatile with jeans  skirts  and black slacks. i was contemplating wearing it with a tulle skirt for nye but it wasn't meant to be. usually my issue with these tops is in the bust and strangely that wasn't the case this time. this is great news!! also they made the sides adjustable so wide hips are not a problem either. however i have muscular arms and well cloth and stone are not thinking about that. they make the uppe,Blouses
0,Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.,Blouses
0,I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.,Blouses
0,The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo  my measurements are 38-30-40.,Blouses
0,For fuller busted folks  this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful.,Blouses
0,"Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it",Blouses
1,"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining  but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",Blouses
1,I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,Blouses
1,I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors  and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season  this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in  but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy  flowy  and the white version is sheer  but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!,Blouses
1,"I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless  big  flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!  i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it  very retro antho  not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight  it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16  but the store had a 12 in the sale room  and not only did it fit  but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the ""wings"" that flare off on t",Blouses
1,A little shorter than expected. very billowy  so watch out for wind!  it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through,Blouses
1,...but it does have it's problems. the neck  although it has pretty button detail at the back  is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat  necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliquã©d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the,Blouses
1,I bought both versions of these tops. the print one has brown  pale pink  and cream colors. these tops look exactly like the picture. they are tts and come with a cami attached. i normally wear a medium and the size 8 is perfect and the arm holes are properly sized  not huge.,Blouses
1,"I was a little hesitant to order this  thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up  ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3""  115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",Blouses
1,Wonderful shirt  soft and flattering... usually wear a medium  but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium  but large is not frumpy at all,Blouses
-1,I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff. i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o,Dresses
-1,The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.,Dresses
-1,"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this",Dresses
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.,Dresses
-1,While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.,Dresses
-1,This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple  black  stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.,Dresses
-1,I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.,Dresses
-1,I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p,Dresses
-1,I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on,Dresses
0,For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this  especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs  and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small  so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work  because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi,Dresses
0,This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.,Dresses
0,This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on,Dresses
0,This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.,Dresses
0,Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.,Dresses
0,This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time  thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it  the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple  chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality  the dress was 100% see-through  very thin  and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk  i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality)  but after trying it on i was really disappoin,Dresses
0,"Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy  and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit ""off "" as the background color is a gray  which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large  as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow  but it was very tight all around  especially around the bust area. going to have to return this...",Dresses

1,This dress is absolutely perfectly delightful! fits like a glove and is stunning on. i couldn't be happier with this purchase! i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time. i usually struggle with dresses because i am under 5 feet  i purchased a 0p and it fits very well. no tailoring needed. only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone  yikes! i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and,Dresses
1,"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap  flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting  the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim  and ordered petite small  and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it",Dresses
1,I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.,Dresses
1,I really love this dress. the material has a lovely feel to the skin  silky. i typically wear a large (occasionally a medium). if i wanted this dress to look like the model it would be the large. i ended up going with a medium because i wanted to accentuate the smallest part of me (rib cage area). this made the black portion a tad snug around the bum  but it eased a bit with wear (but still tighter than model picture)  size down if you want it snug  normal size for a looser  boxier fit. either w,Dresses

1,I love the look of this dress on the hanger in the store and in the pics on the model. but i purchased my usual size 0 in petite ( i am 5 ft 2 in.). it was very form fitting-too much for me- and had little gaps near the waist that i attributed to it being tight the hips. i exchanged it for a 2 petite and that was too large and gaped in the top and waist. for reference my measurements are 32-26-35. so i am going to deduce from my experience and the other reviews that this dress might be best sizi,Dresses
1,This dress is adorable. it's very comfortable and so flattering. the only thing is i can't understand why it is priced so high. it's a great dress  but i'm just not convinced it's the worth the price tag. i'm going to watch for it to go on sale. fingers crossed!,Dresses
1,This dress is especially beautiful in person. the tulle doesn't snag and lays nice and flat  not point. this dress is easy to dress up or dress down  fits comfortably and has some stretch to it. the bodice does run a little high  higher than what is shown in the model picture  but lovely nonetheless.,Dresses
-1,The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.,Fine gauge
-1,This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,Fine gauge
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.,Fine gauge
-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,Fine gauge

-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.,Fine gauge
-1,I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.,Fine gauge
-1,On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.,Fine gauge
0,The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,Fine gauge
0,After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.,Fine gauge
0,I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.,Fine gauge
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,Fine gauge
0,I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.,Fine gauge
0,I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).,Fine gauge

0,This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model  but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.,Fine gauge

1,"I ordered this for my mom in color ""blue motif"". i could not see a difference online between the colors ""brown motif"" and ""blue motif"" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven  but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t",Fine gauge

1,I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink  this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference  i am 5'1  36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.,Fine gauge
1,I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight  comfortable  and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red  but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!,Fine gauge

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates

0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,Jackets

1,I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist  the lapel doesn't lay flat  but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist  you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.,Jackets
1,This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops  and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though  which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp  it actually looks bigger. regardless  i love it and was o,Jackets

1,This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style  possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.,Knits
1,This top is so gorgeous! the color  the embroidery  the neckline  are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part  but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.,Knits
1,Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.,Knits
1,I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium  but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale  the price is reasonable.,Knits
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,I love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome.,Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering

1,Like the look of this tank  ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase,Layering
1,I orderd this product in a size large  because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest (32ddd)  however the opposite happened. because it doesn't have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected  however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect. also  the v is a very nice depth- not too deep or too shallow. overall  i'm happy with it because it's a n,Layering
1,I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,Layering
1,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,Layering
1,As in most ribbed camis  this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.,Layering
1,This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.),Layering
1,Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,Layering
1,The straps are long but work ok for me. the material is very soft and the color (pink) is very nice. this is a tank you can wear under almost anything as the soft silky fabric will allow whatever you wear to glide right over it....no sticking!,Layering
1,"I love this tee  and am a picky tee person. it runs big  the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am 115 lbs and 5'2"". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not 5 stars due to stretched out arm holes.",Layering

-1,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,Legwear
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,Legwear
-1,I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.,Legwear

-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,Legwear

0,So  this dress is extremely comfortable  but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it  my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly  so any issues after having kids  is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable  but not sure if i will keep it.,Lounge
0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,Lounge
0,This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will.

(5'8"" and 135 lbs) this jacket looked giant from the photos so i bought a small. when i first tried it on i thought no way  it's gotta go back. it was enormous and the fit was rather awkward. i looked like the size of a house from all angles. ha! i was still in love with the color and print. as i wore it around the house it began to loose it's rigidity and form against my body in places. it is definitely a jacket you got to play around with. d",Outerwear
1,It's a very light material  so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket  has no zipper or buttons though  so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!,Outerwear
1,Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!,Outerwear
1,As a long standing retailer shopper  i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down; this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well  hooks to close are substantial; the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus  but though the colors are delish  the fabric is a bit questionable.  the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted  but looking at the same vest,Outerwear
1,I love this coat. i bought it in 2012  and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season  but it makes me smile. it's tailored  feminine  and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm  too.,Outerwear
1,I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn't feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it's wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it's vegan leather  they feel compelled to touch it and can't get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special  interesting touch. it's become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn't love getting a compliment every,Outerwear
1,This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.  *highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.,Outerwear
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!,Pants
-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur,Pants
-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.,Pants
-1,Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.,Pants
-1,I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.,Pants
-1,Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,Pants
-1,I adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.,Pants
-1,I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,Pants
-1,Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!,Pants
0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,Pants
0,"High quality  yummy soft fabric  gorgeous color. even with those three pros  this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs  size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one  however has capri pants  hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall  thin woman  it probably works!",Pants
0,"I ordered these with high hopes. i have 2 other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore. i was disappointed. the fabric isn't soft as i expected. the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band  but this might be due to folding while packaged. i tried these on several times - wanting to like them but just couldn't. i am returning them. the colors are beautiful - especially the bands on the bottom. they seem made well. it might just be that i am between sizes. i am 5'4""  115. i tri",Pants
0,I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d  31 waist  38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said  even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first  it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back  get all four panels even  tied  hiding my bra  etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga  i may not have managed. once on  the style looked great. as,Pants
0,"I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of ""genie"" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle  but the worst is the fabric. its ""old lady"" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim  and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping.",Pants
0,I tried this in an xxsp. i am normally an ssxp or xsp. it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie. not the look i was going for. if i sized up  the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame.     also  i don?t feel the quality matched the price point. the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously. that being said  it is a beautiful color and on the right body  the style would work well. it just wasn?t for me.,Pants
0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.,Pants
0,"This pant is beautiful and fits great except for the waist. it is too big. i carry all my extra weight in my waist too. 5' 6 1/2""  150lbs  straight and up down figure. the waist gapped in the back almost 2 inches. otherwise this is a great pant  if you have a well developed bootie  maybe they would fit. ordered a 10 by the way. if they make it to sale  will purchase again and take to tailor. they are a well constructed lovely pant.",Pants
0,"Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2"" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual.",Pants
1,These are very soft and fit well. at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric; each pair is different. but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric  it's a nice difference. i love the pockets  they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them. i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket. take notice makers of woman's pants  there are some of us who *like* deep pockets!    only one negative... i have noticed hei-hei is not sewing,Pants
1,Love these leggings. great fit  great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.,Pants
1,I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1  110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model  these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite  be ready to need alterations to the length!!,Pants
1,I always coveted a pair of flower camos that my sister used to wear. they were perfect  fitted  but not too  casual but not too. i saw these and thought to myself that i finally found them  that i didn't have to covet my sister's pants any more. these check all the boxes--comfy  stylish  high quality  but by the end of the day  they bag out. when i wore them  i had to keep pulling them up--a belt would certainly help. so  i love the pants  but am a bit disappointed with how they lose their shape,Pants
1,Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise  it actually fit! of course  it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs.  and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet  which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi,Pants

1,"I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5""1  104 pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!",Pants
1,I never would have given these pants a second look online  in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me  i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer,Pants
-1,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3  115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.,Shorts
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts
-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,Shorts
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts

0,This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor  though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric  while soft and comfortable  is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears  the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.,Shorts
0,This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.,Shorts

0,"I love these shorts  very pretty and well made  but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs  beware  not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg  creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on ""skinny"" legs.",Shorts
0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.,Shorts
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o,Shorts
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",Shorts
1,These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string  which ended up working out  but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites  but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts  as th,Shorts

1,I tried these on as i needed bottoms to try on some tops (and i was wearing a dress)  but ended up liking them. the fit is snug but comfortable  they didn't ride up and the denim is supple. color is nice too  looked really nice with a swing tank that i half tucked. i have muscular thighs  so shorts are not an easy thing for me... anyway  recommend (tried on 25: 115 lbs  26-27 inch waist),Shorts
1,Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices  but i think this skort will sell out well before then.,Shorts
1,These shorts were just what i expected from retailer. they are more pretty in person  particularly for the color - like a rich clay color  not garish orange. very good quality fabric & the embroidery around the edges is unique. i'm usually a size small in bottoms from retailer & the s fits perfectly.,Shorts

-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.,Skirts

1,After a rough day at the office  i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy. i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on. though it's more than i normally like to spend  it was well worth the price. material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work. fit is spot on (i have wider hips and a smaller waist  which typically makes me a size 12 and that's what i bought). the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors ,Skirts
1,Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawai'i so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.,Skirts

-1,This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.,Sleep
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,Sleep
-1,Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!,Sleep
-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,Sleep
-1,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,Sleep
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,Sleep

-1,I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.,Sleep

0,If the sweater looked as it does in the picture  i would keep it. however  it was very boxy and short  a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.,Sleep

0,I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter  which others do mention  but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape  i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material  is very nice and it's well made  but it's going back.,Sweaters
0,I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference  i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem.,Sweaters

1,I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly  these didn't work for me though. really wish t,Trend
1,This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.,Trend
1,This skirt is really adorable  but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top  so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though  super cute!    the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small  hopefully t,Trend
1,"My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful! i'm so happy i splurged on it. i'm usually a size 6 and the medium fits perfect  although it is quite long (i'm 5'2"" though;). i will probably get it hemmed  but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable. the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning.",Trend
1,"This is just as it looks. a minimalist  elegant  dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight  so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it.",Trend
1,This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy  and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short  but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice  chunky  eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!,Trend
