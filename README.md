# Detect-data-bias-with-Amazon-SageMaker-Clarify
Bias can be present in our data before any model training occurs. Inspecting the dataset for bias can help detect collection gaps, inform our feature engineering, and understand societal biases the dataset may reflect.We will analyze bias on the dataset, generate and analyze bias report, and prepare the dataset for the model training.
